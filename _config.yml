# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  'How can I intuitively create and manipulate 3D content?' is my overall question. My current focus is on generating and animating digital humans and avatars using generative prior.
  
  I am a Ph.D. student at [Visual Media Lab](https://vml.kaist.ac.kr/), [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/), advised by Prof. [Junyong Noh](https://vml.kaist.ac.kr/main/people/person/1). 
  I studied Fine Arts as a Bachelor at [Korea National University of Arts](https://www.karts.ac.kr/en/main.do).
